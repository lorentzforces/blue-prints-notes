H.S. has requested yet another
print of her Ladyship, I assume
for one of her rooms in the West
Wing, as well as an englarged
print of the enclosed photograph.

He said the last development was
too dark so keep an eye on that.

### Music sheet: "1"

_Found in Music Room_

> Musical staff notation is omitted

Find here within these **first** words sung
The key you seek in major tongue,
But half the sheets are missing from
The four you hold the rest far flung,
A half note held is quite the pun.

### Music sheet: "2"

_Found in Music Room_

Among the scattered symphony
A message hidden beneath the keys,
In bold **words** sung by you and me
A fractured note, an urgent plea,
In bold words sung, I do repeat

### Music sheet: "3"

_Found in Music Room_

> Musical staff notation is omitted

The ones of you who oft assume
That you alone can solve this tune,
Are likely going to get your due
And all the rage that will ensue
While working **on** this simple clue


### Music sheet: "4"

_Found in Music Room_

White pages lined with melodies
Do hide the words we've come to seek
And from our choice among all these
We write down one that seems to be
**The** loudest type with ink that bleeds

### Music sheet: "5"

_Found in Greenhouse_

Trees found inside will never shade
The gems that shine in night and rain,
The clue you hold can not be paid
With gems nor coin, tso toss away,
These **sheets** you find a worthy trade

### Music sheet: "8"

_Found in Workshop_

Do spell our secrets carved from thought,
A **message*** read is often lost
Among the bold words, spoken soft,
The note is read, the letter is not

### Note in office desk drawer

BRIDGETTE,
PLEASE CHECK IF ANY BOOKS
MATCHING THESE TITLES ARE
AVAILABLE FOR PURCHASE IN
REDDINGTON.

FLIGHT OF THE QUEEN
**MARCH OF THE COUNT**
FALL OF THE LORD
PASSING OF THE BARONS
HERRINGS OF THE MAJOR

HAD A LITTLE TROUBLE READING
THE BARON'S WRITING, SO I AM
NOT SURE IF THE LAST TITLE IS
INTENDED TO BE HEARINGS OR
HERRINGS, BUT KNOWING HERBERT
I SUSPECT EITHER WOULD BE
SUITABLE.

### Note on office desk about Antechamber levers

THE ANTECHAMBER LEVER
IN THE GREENHOUSE IS BROKEN **AGAIN.**

I DON'T THINK THERE IS ENOUGH
TIME TO PUT IN ANOTHER
WORK ORDER BEFORE SIMON
ARRIVES, SO JUST MAKE SURE
THE **WEST** AND **EAST**
LEVERS ARE OPERATIONAL.

### Note found in front car seat

The drop-off address is 14227 Sandy
Heights. A small garage on the south edge
of Trinsdale.

The goods are already secure and in the
trunk, so just unload and get back here
before noon. I've seen Sinclair's schedule
and I don't think he'll be requesting the
car today but you never know when the
cat will want to get some air.

Tomorrow will likely be the last delivery
and I believe Denny already has payment
ready.

Each of our journeys come to a conclusion here in the tomb.

This floor plan is the definitive **dead end...**
