H.S. has requested yet another
print of her Ladyship, I assume
for one of her rooms in the West
Wing, as well as an englarged
print of the enclosed photograph.

He said the last development was
too dark so keep an eye on that.

### Note in office desk drawer

BRIDGETTE,
PLEASE CHECK IF ANY BOOKS
MATCHING THESE TITLES ARE
AVAILABLE FOR PURCHASE IN
REDDINGTON.

PASSING OF THE BARONS

SUITABLE.

### Note on office desk about Antechamber levers

THE **WEST** AND **EAST**

### Note found in front car seat

The drop-off address is 14227 Sandy
Heights. A small garage on the south edge
of Trinsdale.

The goods are already secure and in the
trunk, so just unload and get back here
before noon. I've seen Sinclair's schedule
and I don't think he'll be requesting the
car today but you never know when the
cat will want to get some air.

Tomorrow will likely be the last delivery
and I believe Denny already has payment
ready.

Each of our journeys come to a conclusion here in the tomb.

This floor plan is the definitive **dead end...**
