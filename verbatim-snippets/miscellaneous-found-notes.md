H.S. has requested yet another
print of her Ladyship, I assume
for one of her rooms in the West
Wing, as well as an englarged
print of the enclosed photograph.

He said the last development was
too dark so keep an eye on that.

### Music sheet: "1"

_Found in Music Room_

> Musical staff notation is omitted

Find here within these **first** words sung
The key you seek in major tongue,
But half the sheets are missing from
The four you hold the rest far flung,
A half note held is quite the pun.

### Music sheet: "2"

_Found in Music Room_

Among the scattered symphony
A message hidden beneath the keys,
In bold **words** sung by you and me
A fractured note, an urgent plea,
In bold words sung, I do repeat

The ones of you who oft assume
That you alone can solve this tune,
Are likely going to get your due
And all the rage that will ensue
While working **on** this simple clue


### Music sheet: "4"

White pages lined with melodies
Do hide the words we've come to seek
And from our choice among all these
We write down one that seems to be
**The** loudest type with ink that bleeds

### Music sheet: "5"

_Found in Greenhouse_

The gems that shine in night and rain,
The clue you hold can not be paid
With gems nor coin, tso toss away,

And to the floor we **are** compelled
The gowns glide on and music swells
And at the end the clock strikes twelve
What that means only time can tell

### Music sheet: "7"

_Found in Ballroom_

Two remain for one last dance,
And spin a gain around clock hands,
And as they turn, a second chance
To rise above the falling sands
The **true** time lost in past romance.

### Music sheet: "8"

_Found in Workshop_

Do spell our secrets carved from thought,
A **message*** read is often lost
Among the bold words, spoken soft,
The note is read, the letter is not

BRIDGETTE,

AVAILABLE FOR PURCHASE IN
REDDINGTON.

### Note found in front car seat

The drop-off address is 14227 Sandy
Heights. A small garage on the south edge
of Trinsdale.

The goods are already secure and in the
trunk, so just unload and get back here
before noon. I've seen Sinclair's schedule
and I don't think he'll be requesting the
car today but you never know when the
cat will want to get some air.

Tomorrow will likely be the last delivery
and I believe Denny already has payment
ready.

### Room 46 note about sanctum doors

```
The first key found here on the furthest rank,
The second locked tight in the vault of a bank,
The third is high up, among all the clocks,
And the fourth down below, beneath all the docks.
The fifth key is held by a king on his throne.
The sixth in a station, left by one of your own,
The seventh is major if you draft it quite late,
And the last key is waiting, behind the last door of eight.
```

### Poem in Clock Tower

Southward I see a swan,

Ashen like sands of the shore,

Carried by westwardly winds,

Rogue like the moon of the north.

Eastward I see a crow,

Dark are the days coming fourth.
