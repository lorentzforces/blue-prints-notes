# Leads & Unattributed Clues

### Unanswered Questions

- Are doors with keyholes just _potentially_ locked, and doors without keyholes never locked?
- How does one get water into the reserve tank in the Pump Room?
- What happens if you spend more than 24 hours in a single day?
- Data transfers from Synka? (mentioned in terminals)
- What can you build with a broken lever, a battery, and a sledgehammer?
- The Schoolhouse adds 8 Classrooms to the deck, with each grade level providing a hint. Probably want to maximize these at some point to get as much info as possible.
- The insurgent group that these people seemed to be a part of was called "The Children of Black Water," which seems to be a parallel name to "Blackbridge" being the network and grotto name. Their group is also called RLCF - what does that stand for?

### Current open access problems

- How to get to other parts of the Abandoned Mine gear-platform room (seems to be Reservoir via the boat, which requires a lower water level)
- Terminal in Blackbridge Grotto requires an "admin key" to log in
- Door in Blackbridge Grotto seems to want a microchip, but the microchip that begins there can also be moved?
- Stripey mine(?) entrance doors near the Apple Orchard

### Utility Closet

- Can toggle off keycard system
- Light puzzle: "V.A.C. indicators" (see note)
  - Email: white indicator only shown after syncing all 6 indicators to purple
  - Correct sequence is: off, blue, green, white, red, purple
- Unclear what the VAC light puzzle affects
- Four breaker switch locations
  - Gymnasium (power off removes the penalty for entering)
  - Dark room (power on removes the penalty for the light being off)
  - Garage (power on allows the door to open, allowing access to the west grounds)
  - Cabinet (crossed out and no switch present)

### Garage

- The car keys unlock the boot, which contains a battery and the Secret Garden key

### Shelter (outer room)

- Terminal with these options:
  - Time-lock safe
    - must set time at least one hour in future (date + time)
    - safe will remain open for 4 hours once opened
  - Radiation Monitor
  - Login to network
    - requires password
- radiation is generated by experiments in the Laboratory
- if radiation reading is 12 uSv or higher, all doors in the house will unlock

### Mail Room

- Mail bag in corner has several numbers on it
  - `4534782` (more obvious)
  - `34562343` (tiny)
- Letter from Simon's dad to Simon, implying that Day 1 is a Saturday (Simon arrives on a Friday night)

### Campsite

- Picture with standing tree has "11-28" carved in it
- Stripey mine entrance doors

### Laboratory

- Experiments can alter conditions (seems to usually be an "when X then Y" type of arrangement

### Freezer

- Cannot be drafted the day after it is drafted.
- Has a thermometer display when in it, likely have to raise temperature enough to unthaw items to make them accessible
- How? Probably the boiler room or furnace? (more likely boiler since via the Laboratory we already know that the boiler room can have output directed to other rooms somehow)
- Temperature looks like it needs to be indicating at least in the neighborhood of 17-18 C to "fully" thaw.

### Library

- checkout system is another "holdover" mechanic where the results is available after the end of that day
- book selection menu appears to be the same no matter what

### Root Cellar

- root cellar has a family tree of Mary Epsen and her ancestors

### Boiler Room

Can interact with:
- Laboratory
- Garage
- Laundry Room
- Furnace
- Pump Room

### Pump Room

Can interact with:
- Pool
- Aquarium
- Greenhouse
- Kitchen (although this seems to have no meaningful effect)
- Reservoir
- Fountain

### Blackbridge Grotto

Can use one offline terminal per day. (currently inaccessible)

### Greenhouse

The greenhouse contains a broken lever which appears to be marked as the "south" one.

The greenhouse appears to be able to grow plants which produce gems.

### Catacombs

- Accessible via Tomb after manipulating the angel statues in this order:
  - farmer, hoe (I)
  - cook, shovel (II)
  - ranch, pitchfork (III)
  - chimney sweep, duster (IV)
  - maid, broom (V)
  - rider, crop (VI)
  - knight, scepter (VII)
- See catacombs map screenshots in the images directory.
- Abandoned Mines is accessible from the door with an arrow (back to the left), has an open round area with eight hallways, of which you enter in one. A cogged platform in the middle seems to be able to spin, and can connect two hallways which are separated by two other hallways (i.e. gear with 8 cogs has longer cogs on cog 1 and cog 4)
- A second gear below the immediately visible one suggests that the entire assembly can be raised, making one gear capable of connection two of eight hallways on the _upper_ level and the bottom one capable of connecting the bottom hallways.
- Following further enters the Reservoir, which at full height has an inaccessible boat. Accessing the boat likely requires a specific amount of water to be drained from the Reservoir.
- Beyond the Reservoir is the Basement Door which provides access via the drained fountain regardless of whether the Tomb is present.

### Classroom

- requires Schoolhouse outer room to be in draft pool
- every student's favorite color is red?
- **GRADE 1:** Color worksheet (no idea if this is important, but WHO KNOWS) correct key:
  - wagon: red
  - hydrant: red
  - flag with heart: orange
  - pumpkin: orange
  - bananas: yellow
  - map: yellow
  - lizard: green
  - broccoli: green
  - flag with mountain: blue
  - pond: blue
  - flag with hourglass: purple
  - grapes: purple
- **GRADE 2:** Math worksheet (guide to Billiard Room puzzle)

### Secret Garden

- access by using the Secret Garden key on a door leading to the East or West wing (unclear if East & West variants are at all different)
- there is a suspicious door-looking indentation in the brick wall

### Foundation

- There is an elevator above an open shaft with a throw-switch in it, but the elevator is lifted up high and is inaccessible. How does this become accessible?
