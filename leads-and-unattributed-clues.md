# Leads & Unattributed Clues

### Run goals

- Get classrooms for grades 5-8
- Draft a furnace next to a freezer
  - ...and connect it to ducts
- Get a power hammer with brick walls (multiple in single run, preferably)
- Get a pump room and draw down the reservoir to 6/0 pips

### Unanswered Questions

- Are doors with keyholes just _potentially_ locked, and doors without keyholes never locked?
- Data transfers from Synka? (mentioned in terminals, still unknown since admin access to the Blackbridge Grotto terminal didn't enable this so far as I can tell)
- What can you build with a broken lever, a battery, and a sledgehammer?
- The Schoolhouse adds 8 Classrooms to the deck, with each grade level providing a hint. Probably want to maximize these at some point to get as much info as possible.
- The insurgent group that these people seemed to be a part of was called "The Children of Black Water," which seems to be a parallel name to "Blackbridge" being the network and grotto name. Their group is also called RLCF - what does that stand for?
- Who the fuck is Samantha Hayes?
  - _a.k.a_ Marion Matthew Jones neÃ© Epsen _a.k.a._ Marion Marigold _a.k.a._ Jean Ribbon
  - Two Fenn Aries passports found so far for "Jean Ribbon" and "Samantha Hayes"
- Does the three-mountain (overlapping triangles) symbol mean anything significant?
- Message from music sheets: "First words on the sheets are true message" -> "Find among the white trees under two stones"
  - Near campsite, bring shovel
- What does the ductwork do when connected to the Garage?

### Current open access problems

- How to get across the Reservoir via boat
  - 13/14 pips of water level is correct for the boat
- How to get to the "station"
  - 6/14 pips is the entry to the "station?"
- Terminal in Blackbridge Grotto requires an "admin key" to log in
  - First four letters of last name followed by first initial, 1st and 5th character capitalized)
  - Login has been given to "Mr. Ruota," found in Hartley's room (servant's quarters)
  - Hypothesis: "RoutH" (INCORRECT)
- Door in Blackbridge Grotto seems to want a microchip, but the microchip that begins there can also be moved?
- the Precipice has an uninteractable, closed door
- In Reservoir, there are steps leading down on the basement side into the water (appears likely that it requires the Reservoir to be fully drained)
  - the fully drained reservoir has an allowance token still available in it

### Utility Closet

- Can toggle off keycard system
- Four breaker switch locations
  - Gymnasium (power off removes the penalty for entering)
  - Dark room (power on removes the penalty for the light being off)
  - Garage (power on allows the door to open, allowing access to the west grounds)
  - Cabinet (crossed out and no switch present)

### Garage

- The car keys unlock the boot, which contains a battery and the Secret Garden key (if Secret Garden key is not already found)

### Shelter (outer room)

- Terminal with these options:
  - Time-lock safe
    - must set time at least one hour in future (date + time)
    - safe will remain open for 4 hours once opened
  - Radiation Monitor
  - Login to network
    - requires password
- radiation is generated by experiments in the Laboratory
- if radiation reading is 12 uSv or higher, all doors in the house will unlock (this appears to require a LOT of experiment procs)

### Laboratory

- Experiments can alter conditions (seems to usually be an "when X then Y" type of arrangement)

### Freezer

- Cannot be drafted the day after it is drafted.
- Has a thermometer display when in it, likely have to raise temperature enough to unthaw items to make them accessible
- How? Probably the boiler room or furnace? (more likely boiler since via the Laboratory we already know that the boiler room can have output directed to other rooms somehow)
- Temperature looks like it needs to be indicating at least in the neighborhood of 17-18 C to "fully" thaw.
- Note regarding temperature found in lab indicates that thawing does not affect the contents of the cooler.
- Cooler contains a frozen special key and a frozen document
- Furnace being nearby will thaw the freezer

### Library

- checkout system is another "holdover" mechanic where the results is available after the end of that day
- book selection menu appears to be the same no matter what

### Root Cellar

- root cellar has a family tree of Mary Epsen and her ancestors

### Boiler Room

Can interact with:
- Laboratory
- Garage
- Laundry Room
- Furnace
- Pump Room

### Pump Room

Can interact with:
- Pool
- Aquarium
- Greenhouse
- Kitchen (although this seems to have no meaningful effect)
- Reservoir
- Fountain

### Blackbridge Grotto

Can use one offline terminal per day.

Account keys are first four letters of last name followed by first initial, 1st and 5th character capitalized)

Accessed initially with Anne Babbage's account.

Active accounts:
  - MoorR (admin, Synka related)
  - ThomK (admin, transfer from Synka, former assistant to H.S. Sinclair)
  - BabbA (personnel admin)
  - ? Darren Kirk? (security)

Archive access apparently also exists, but no account currently known has this access. (can view deleted logs/db entries)

Offsite connections are still disabled.

### Greenhouse

The greenhouse contains a broken lever which opens the South Antechamber door.

The greenhouse can grow plants which produce gems.

### Catacombs

- Accessible via Tomb after manipulating the angel statues in this order:
  - farmer, hoe (I)
  - cook, shovel (II)
  - ranch, pitchfork (III)
  - chimney sweep, duster (IV)
  - maid, broom (V)
  - rider, crop (VI)
  - knight, scepter (VII)
- See catacombs map screenshots in the images directory.
- Abandoned Mines is accessible from the door with an arrow (back to the left), has an open round area with eight hallways, of which you enter in one. A cogged platform in the middle seems to be able to spin, and can connect two hallways which are separated by two other hallways (i.e. gear with 8 cogs has longer cogs on cog 1 and cog 4)
- A second gear below the immediately visible one suggests that the entire assembly can be raised, making one gear capable of connection two of eight hallways on the _upper_ level and the bottom one capable of connecting the bottom hallways.
- Following further enters the Reservoir, which at full height has an inaccessible boat. Accessing the boat likely requires a specific amount of water to be drained from the Reservoir.
- Beyond the Reservoir is the Basement Door which provides access via the drained fountain regardless of whether the Tomb is present (any amount of water in the fountain makes this inaccessible).

### Classroom

- requires Schoolhouse outer room to be in draft pool
- every student's favorite color is red? (PATRIOTISM)
- -1 * 2 + 3 - 4 + 5 * 6 - 7 + 8 * 9 + 10
  - "8" is sideways like the South pole continent symbol
  - three ways to interpret this
    - actual math order of operations: 102
    - strictly left-to-right: 118
    - grouping operations in the same order as the dartboard: 1512
- **GRADE 1:** Color worksheet (no idea if this is important, but WHO KNOWS) correct key:
  - wagon: red
  - hydrant: red
  - flag with heart: orange
  - pumpkin: orange
  - bananas: yellow
  - blueprint: blue
  - lizard: green
  - broccoli: green
  - flag with mountain: yellow

  - W At Er
  - I Ce
  - S Te Am
- **GRADE 4:** [MUCH GEOGRAPHY](./geography.md)

### Secret Garden

- access by using the Secret Garden key on a door leading to the East or West wing (east & west appear to be functionally identical)
- has a moon shrine symbol accessible via brick wall switch
- has a sigil for Orinda Aries accessible via brick wall switch

### Greenhouse

- there is a suspicious door-looking indentation in the brick wall (seems to match similar in Secret Garden)

### Billiard Room

Colors/operators
- square(bullseye): literal square (^2), operates on total of the ring with the same color
- light blue: addition
- yellow: subtraction
- pink: multiplication
- purple: division

### Basement

- Business card with teapot depicted on stand, "Hundred Bells" over it, handwritten note says "Sandy Heights 5 PM"
  - Hundred Bells Tea Room is near Trinsdale Lake, and is open to the public for lunch on Mondays and Fridays

### List of Staff

- Anne Babbage
- ? Routa

### Gallery

Contents are as follows:

- THICK (k is thinner font face) with a hand flying overhead grasping manacles, with shooting stardust coming out of the wrist
  - 5 letters (THICK?)
- Eyeballs with "Actual Objective" sign, bottle labeled "GENU" on a table made out of the letters "VERI"
  - 7 letters
- Infinity symbol pierced with many nails supported by two columns in a stone-block room, bins labeled with each of the 7 deadly sins around. Animal-skin rug in front, framed picture of a shark fin on the left.
  - 8 letters
- Two (radio flyer style) wagons in midair, each holding a rose, an apple, a stop sign, and a fire hydrant. A large block "P" is also on top of the wagon on the right
  - 6 letters

### Room 46

Two clocks on the wall are stopped at 1:30.

Four(ish) busts:
- Sinclair (man)
- Epsen (woman)
- Jones (boy, ME)
- Marigold (empty plinth)

Rough map of the world with 8 numbered tacks (1-8) and a handwritten note "8 realms in 8 months." Notably, there are only 7 interactable countries on this map. This may mean that both Orinda Aries and Fenn Aries need to be represented in the solution (in the same location).

The top of the map (above the handwritten bit) may be the arch-shaped realm icon.

The bookshelf has a miniature red wagon with a rose and an apple in it (reference to the Gallery piece?)

The fireplace has the realm icons over the top of it in this order: ticket, pentagon, hourglass, mountain, V, diagonal jigsaw, arch, diamond. Placing pins on the map in this room in that order corresponding to the countries did not appear to do anything.

### Inner Sanctum Rooms

Sanctum key locations:

"The first key found here on the furthest rank,"
- Located in Room 46

"The second locked tight in the vault of a bank,"

"The third is high up, among all the clocks,"

"And the fourth down below, beneath all the docks."
  - "the pink boxes do not contain any prizes"
  - "a prize is in a box marked by 'flame icon'" (green, is true)
  - "the box containing allowance tokens is white" (green, is true)
  - "the green notes you find in this room will always be true" (green, is true)

"The fifth key is held by a king on his throne."

"The sixth in a station, left by one of your own,"

"The seventh is major if you draft it quite late,"

"And the last key is waiting, behind the last door of eight."

Based on Room 1, these rooms each have a mechanism for the sigil of one realm.

Room 1: Ticket icon (Orinda Aries)

### Great Hall

Layout of which doors lead where changes on a daily basis.

### Passports

All so far are Fenn Aries passports issued Jan 10 1984, expiring 10 years later

- Jean Ribbon, DOB July 9, 1956 -- # 455 / FA815112
- Samantha Hayes, DOB Jan 12, 1954, ID page is marked with red X -- # 455 / FA815544
- Grey Daniels, DOB May 1, 1956, ID page is marked "compromised" in red -- # 455 / FA815232

### Observatory

For a given star count, the constellations seen are deterministic. I'm not gonna try to optimize that shit though.
