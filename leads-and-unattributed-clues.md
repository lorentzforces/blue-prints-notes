# Leads & Unattributed Clues

### Unanswered Questions

- What does clocking in & out do? Note says it's related to payroll
- Are doors with keyholes just _potentially_ locked, and doors without keyholes never locked?
- Can you enter the east grounds? (private drive view AND east-side open rooms suggest this may not be possible, or at least not possible at lower ranks)
- Model airplane in bushes outside? (west?)
- How does one get water into the reserve tank in the Pump Room?
- What happens if you spend more than 24 hours in a single day?
- We know that there are three possible entrances to the Antechamber. The southern entrance is said to have a broken lever, although it is not clear if this refers to the broken lever item which can be found, or just an indication that the southern entrance is not functional at all. Attempts so far to path to the Antechamber with other rooms has produced blank doorways - there must be specific conditions (probably specific rooms?) in place to enter the Antechamber at all. The Greenhouse is mentioned as the location where the lever is broken, so we might try placing a Greenhouse there. (Author's note: I do not know what needs to be done to make drafting a Greenhouse possible.)

### Front entrance

- fountain is [currently] drained, basement door below requires unique key

### Note to "bridgette"

- calls for an "even spread" for the guest, which may imply that the number of fruits found in a given run is finite?
  - 5 apples
  - 5 bananas
  - 5 oranges
- "50 steps should be more than enough"

### Clocking in & out

- Terminals are in Security & Laboratory rooms (and also the office?)
- Terminal password starts with "S"

### Boudoir

- There is a safe (free gem)
  - combination was 1225 (Christmas Day, safe was a gift
  - contained letter (red, with "4" on the front) from Daniel admonishing Herbert for his treatment of Marion's (mom??) death (she was a rebel?)

### Utility Closet

- Can toggle off keycard system
- Light puzzle: "V.A.C. indicators" (see note)
- Unclear what the VAC light puzzle affects
- Four breaker switch locations
  - Gymnasium (power off removes the penalty for entering)
  - Dark room (power on removes the penalty for the light being off)
  - Garage (power on allows the door to open, allowing access to the west grounds)
  - Cabinet (crossed out and no switch present)

### Dark Room

- Contains note talking about a request to develop specific pictures
- Note references an "enlarged print of the enclosed photograph," which does not appear to be the picture which appears behind the note. The central table in the darkroom features a picture of Sinclair with a camera, and a blown-up feature of just the camera. The camera is labeled "Synka Co," and the room appears to have a bathtub in it.
- There are several versions of a picture featuring maids in various levels of overexposure

### Garage

- Car license plate: `SWNSNG`
- When power is on, door can be opened for access to the outer grounds

### West Grounds

- Entered from Garage at rank 4

### Shelter (outer room)

- Terminal with these options:
  - Time-lock safe
    - must set time at least one hour in future (date + time)
    - safe will remain open for 4 hours once opened
  - Radiation Monitor
  - Login to network
    - requires password
- radiation is generated by experiments in the Laboratory
- if radiation reading is 12 uSv or higher, all doors in the house will unlock

### Mail Room

- Mail bag in corner has several numbers on it
  - `4534782` (more obvious)
  - `34562343` (tiny)
- Letter from Simon's dad to Simon, implying that Day 1 is a Saturday (Simon arrives on a Friday night)

### Campsite

- Apple trees and fence are here, fence has 4-digit combination lock
- Tree with heart carved on it from picture is cut down
- Stripey mine entrance doors

### Laboratory

- Experiments can alter conditions (seems to usually be an "when X then Y" type of arrangement
- Machine in laboratory needs boiler room energy. See [the laboratory elements clue](./laboratory-elements-puzzle.md) for at least one hint towards operation of that machine.

### Freezer

- Has a thermometer display when in it, likely have to raise temperature enough to unthaw items to make them accessible
- How? Probably the boiler room or furnace? (more likely boiler since via the Laboratory we already know that the boiler room can have output directed to other rooms somehow)
- Temperature looks like it needs to be indicating at least in the neighborhood of 17-18 C to "fully" thaw.

### Maid's Chamber

- Note here says staff must vacate by Friday, November 6th. This may imply that day 1 is Saturday, November 7th.

### Library

- checkout system is another "holdover" mechanic where the results is available after the end of that day
- should check if different selections of books are available on different days, try to get books from the note found in the Office
