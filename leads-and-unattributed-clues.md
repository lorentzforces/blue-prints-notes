# Leads & Unattributed Clues

### Unanswered Questions

- Are doors with keyholes just _potentially_ locked, and doors without keyholes never locked?
- How does one get water into the reserve tank in the Pump Room?
- What happens if you spend more than 24 hours in a single day?
- Data transfers from Synka? (mentioned in terminals)
- What can you build with a broken lever, a battery, and a sledgehammer?
- The Schoolhouse adds 8 Classrooms to the deck, with each grade level providing a hint. Probably want to maximize these at some point to get as much info as possible.
- The insurgent group that these people seemed to be a part of was called "The Children of Black Water," which seems to be a parallel name to "Blackbridge" being the network and grotto name. Their group is also called RLCF - what does that stand for?
- Who the fuck is Samantha Hayes?
  - a.k.a Marion Matthew Jones ne√© Epsen _a.k.a._ Marion Marigold

### Current open access problems

- How to get across the Reservoir via boat
  - 4 empty pips of water level is too low
- Terminal in Blackbridge Grotto requires an "admin key" to log in
  - First four letters of last name followed by first initial, 1st and 5th character capitalized)
  - Login has been given to "Mr. Ruota," found in Hartley's room (servant's quarters)
  - Hypothesis: "RoutH" (INCORRECT)
- Door in Blackbridge Grotto seems to want a microchip, but the microchip that begins there can also be moved?
- the Precipice has an uninteractable, closed door
- In Basement (hallway 9 on map) red door with electronic box attached
- In Basement (hallway 9, at lever to Room 46) there are eight doors which are currently non-interactable
- In Reservoir, there are steps leading down on the basement side into the water (appears likely that it requires the Reservoir to be fully drained)
- The Chess Puzzle
- Room 46: the second time?

### Utility Closet

- Can toggle off keycard system
- Four breaker switch locations
  - Gymnasium (power off removes the penalty for entering)
  - Dark room (power on removes the penalty for the light being off)
  - Garage (power on allows the door to open, allowing access to the west grounds)
  - Cabinet (crossed out and no switch present)

### Garage

- The car keys unlock the boot, which contains a battery and the Secret Garden key (if Secret Garden key is not already found)

### Shelter (outer room)

- Terminal with these options:
  - Time-lock safe
    - must set time at least one hour in future (date + time)
    - safe will remain open for 4 hours once opened
  - Radiation Monitor
  - Login to network
    - requires password
- radiation is generated by experiments in the Laboratory
- if radiation reading is 12 uSv or higher, all doors in the house will unlock (this appears to require a LOT of experiment procs)

### Laboratory

- Experiments can alter conditions (seems to usually be an "when X then Y" type of arrangement)

### Freezer

- Cannot be drafted the day after it is drafted.
- Has a thermometer display when in it, likely have to raise temperature enough to unthaw items to make them accessible
- How? Probably the boiler room or furnace? (more likely boiler since via the Laboratory we already know that the boiler room can have output directed to other rooms somehow)
- Temperature looks like it needs to be indicating at least in the neighborhood of 17-18 C to "fully" thaw.

### Library

- checkout system is another "holdover" mechanic where the results is available after the end of that day
- book selection menu appears to be the same no matter what

### Root Cellar

- root cellar has a family tree of Mary Epsen and her ancestors

### Boiler Room

Can interact with:
- Laboratory
- Garage
- Laundry Room
- Furnace
- Pump Room

### Pump Room

Can interact with:
- Pool
- Aquarium
- Greenhouse
- Kitchen (although this seems to have no meaningful effect)
- Reservoir
- Fountain

### Blackbridge Grotto

Can use one offline terminal per day.

Terminal in grotto is currently inaccessible

### Greenhouse

The greenhouse contains a broken lever which appears to be marked as the "south" one.

The greenhouse appears to be able to grow plants which produce gems.

### Catacombs

- Accessible via Tomb after manipulating the angel statues in this order:
  - farmer, hoe (I)
  - cook, shovel (II)
  - ranch, pitchfork (III)
  - chimney sweep, duster (IV)
  - maid, broom (V)
  - rider, crop (VI)
  - knight, scepter (VII)
- See catacombs map screenshots in the images directory.
- Abandoned Mines is accessible from the door with an arrow (back to the left), has an open round area with eight hallways, of which you enter in one. A cogged platform in the middle seems to be able to spin, and can connect two hallways which are separated by two other hallways (i.e. gear with 8 cogs has longer cogs on cog 1 and cog 4)
- A second gear below the immediately visible one suggests that the entire assembly can be raised, making one gear capable of connection two of eight hallways on the _upper_ level and the bottom one capable of connecting the bottom hallways.
- Following further enters the Reservoir, which at full height has an inaccessible boat. Accessing the boat likely requires a specific amount of water to be drained from the Reservoir.
- Beyond the Reservoir is the Basement Door which provides access via the drained fountain regardless of whether the Tomb is present.

### Classroom

- requires Schoolhouse outer room to be in draft pool
- every student's favorite color is red? (PATRIOTISM)
- -1 * 2 + 3 - 4 + 5 * 6 - 7 + 8 * 9 + 10
  - "8" is sideways like the South pole continent symbol
  - three ways to interpret this
    - actual math order of operations: 102
    - strictly left-to-right: 118
    - grouping operations in the same order as the dartboard: 1512
- **GRADE 1:** Color worksheet (no idea if this is important, but WHO KNOWS) correct key:
  - wagon: red
  - hydrant: red
  - flag with heart: orange

  - bananas: yellow
  - map: yellow
  - lizard: green

  - W At Er
  - I Ce
  - S Te Am
- **GRADE 4:** [MUCH GEOGRAPHY](./geography.md)

### Secret Garden

- access by using the Secret Garden key on a door leading to the East or West wing (east & west appear to be functionally identical)
- there is a suspicious door-looking indentation in the brick wall (seems to match similar in Greenhouse)
