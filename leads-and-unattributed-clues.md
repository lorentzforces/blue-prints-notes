# Leads & Unattributed Clues

### Unanswered Questions

- What does clocking in & out do? Note says it's related to payroll
- Does the trueness of memo colors persiste between runs, or is it different? (seen same: 2)
- Are doors with keyholes just _potentially_ locked, and doors without keyholes never locked?
- Does "west wing" and "east wing" just mean the left and right sides of the map, respectively? (seems like yes, but might be the VERY left and right columns only)
- Can garages only be drafted on the edge of the map? (i.e. columns 1 and 5)
- Can you enter the east grounds? (private drive view AND east-side open rooms suggest this may not be possible, or at least not possible at lower ranks)
