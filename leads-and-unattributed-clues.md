# Leads & Unattributed Clues

### Unanswered Questions

- Are doors with keyholes just _potentially_ locked, and doors without keyholes never locked?
- How does one get water into the reserve tank in the Pump Room?
- What happens if you spend more than 24 hours in a single day?
- We know that there are three possible entrances to the Antechamber. The southern entrance is said to have a broken lever, and the direction of the lever (e.g. "south lever," "west lever") corresponds to the Antechamber entrance that lever operates. Attempts so far to path to the Antechamber with other rooms has produced blank doorways - there must be specific conditions (probably specific rooms?) in place to enter the Antechamber at all.
- Data transfers from Synka? (mentioned in terminals)
- What can you build with a broken lever, a battery, and a sledgehammer?

### Current open access problems

- Basement door in Fountain (locked, requires unique key, requires fountain to be drained)
- Basement door in Reservoir room (locked, no message about key)
- How to get to other parts of the Abandoned Mine gear-platform room
- How to access the Secret Garden (key is available via car boot in Garage w/ car keys)
- Terminal in Blackbridge Grotto requires an "admin key" to log in
- Door in Blackbridge Grotto seems to want a microchip, but the microchip that begins there can also be moved?
- Stripey mine(?) entrance doors near the Apple Orchard

### Utility Closet

- Can toggle off keycard system
- Light puzzle: "V.A.C. indicators" (see note)
  - Email: white indicator only shown after syncing all 6 indicators to purple
  - Correct sequence is: off, blue, green, white, red, purple
- Unclear what the VAC light puzzle affects
- Four breaker switch locations
  - Gymnasium (power off removes the penalty for entering)
  - Dark room (power on removes the penalty for the light being off)
  - Garage (power on allows the door to open, allowing access to the west grounds)
  - Cabinet (crossed out and no switch present)

### Garage

- The car keys unlock the boot, which contains a battery and the Secret Garden key

### Shelter (outer room)

- Terminal with these options:
  - Time-lock safe
    - must set time at least one hour in future (date + time)
    - safe will remain open for 4 hours once opened
  - Radiation Monitor
  - Login to network
    - requires password
- radiation is generated by experiments in the Laboratory
- if radiation reading is 12 uSv or higher, all doors in the house will unlock

### Mail Room

- Mail bag in corner has several numbers on it
  - `4534782` (more obvious)
  - `34562343` (tiny)
- Letter from Simon's dad to Simon, implying that Day 1 is a Saturday (Simon arrives on a Friday night)

### Campsite

- Picture with standing tree has "11-28" carved in it
- Stripey mine entrance doors

### Laboratory

- Experiments can alter conditions (seems to usually be an "when X then Y" type of arrangement

### Freezer

- Cannot be drafted the day after it is drafted.
- Has a thermometer display when in it, likely have to raise temperature enough to unthaw items to make them accessible
- How? Probably the boiler room or furnace? (more likely boiler since via the Laboratory we already know that the boiler room can have output directed to other rooms somehow)
- Temperature looks like it needs to be indicating at least in the neighborhood of 17-18 C to "fully" thaw.

### Library

- checkout system is another "holdover" mechanic where the results is available after the end of that day
- book selection menu appears to be the same no matter what

### Root Cellar

- root cellar has a family tree of Mary Epsen and her ancestors

### Boiler Room

Can interact with:
- Laboratory
- Garage
- Laundry Room
- Furnace
- Pump Room

### Pump Room

Can interact with:
- Pool
- Aquarium
- Greenhouse
- Kitchen (although this seems to have no meaningful effect)
- Reservoir
- Fountain

### Blackbridge Grotto

Can use one offline terminal per day. (currently inaccessible)

### Greenhouse

The greenhouse contains a broken lever which appears to be marked as the "south" one.

The greenhouse appears to be able to grow plants which produce gems.

### Catacombs

- Accessible via Tomb after manipulating the angel statues in this order:
  - farmer, hoe (I)
  - cook, shovel (II)
  - ranch, pitchfork (III)
  - chimney sweep, duster (IV)
  - maid, broom (V)
  - rider, crop (VI)
  - knight, scepter (VII)
- See catacombs map screenshots in the images directory.
- Abandoned Mines is accessible from the door with an arrow (back to the left), has an open round area with eight hallways, of which you enter in one. A cogged platform in the middle seems to be able to spin, and can connect two hallways which are separated by two other hallways (i.e. gear with 8 cogs has longer cogs on cog 1 and cog 4)
- A second gear below the immediately visible one suggests that the entire assembly can be raised, making one gear capable of connection two of eight hallways on the _upper_ level and the bottom one capable of connecting the bottom hallways.
- Following further enters the Reservoir, which at full height has an inaccessible boat. Accessing the boat likely requires a specific amount of water to be drained from the Reservoir.
- Beyond the Reservoir is a door to the Basement. The door is locked. (may require a special key?)
