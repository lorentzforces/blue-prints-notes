# The Erajan Language

Early Erajan did not use any verbs, so today the rare usage of verbs are comprised almost entirely of loan words and are mainly used to describe physical actions.

Modifiers take the form of affixes, which typically have a standard and inverted form which are present at the beginning or end (reversed) of the word, respectively.

### Base vocabulary

- LOR (word)

- INN (north)

> _Do double letters mean anything? Since all the directions end in a double letter, would a version of that word without the double letter mean anything? In other words, would "is" mean anything related to "south" when "iss" means south in some context?

### Affixes

**Known:**

| Prefix                   | Suffix                   |
|--------------------------|--------------------------|
| AJ (first)               | JA (last)                |

**Tentative:**

| Prefix                   | Suffix                   |
|--------------------------|--------------------------|
| EJ (in?)                 | JE (out?)                |


### Grammar & semantics

EL/LE can be paired with a verb, in which case it can mean "I will" or "I won't" respectively. UL/LU can be used in the same way in the second person.

### Some examples

- "Hello, can you teach me a new word?" _ajlor ulteach nevlor_ (first word you teach new word)
- "The large house is toward the east" _hewam ovett_ (large house toward east)
- "I will swim at dawn" - _elswim nevdau_ (I swim start of day)
- "I won't read at night" - _readle nai_ (read not me night)
- "the branches of the tree are old" - _ven treiven_ (the ends of the tree are old)
- "the trunk of the tree is small" - _manevtrei_ (the small start of the tree)

ajlor = hello ("first word")
lorja = goodbye ("last word")

> _Does the letter "d" mean something when included inside of a word? In the Erajan note left in the tomb, the letter "d" seems to be some kind of conjunction between other elements inside of a full word. It may be possessive, in which case "eld" means "my" and "uld" means "yours".
