### Grammar & semantics

EL/LE can be paired with a verb, in which case it can mean "I will" or "I won't" respectively. UL/LU can be used in the same way in the second person.

### Some examples

- "Hello, can you teach me a new word?" _ajlor ulteach nevlor_ (first word you teach new word)
- "The large house is toward the east" _hewam ovett_ (large house toward east)
- "I will swim at dawn" - _elswim nevdau_ (I swim start of day)
- "I won't read at night" - _readle nai_ (read not me night)
- "the branches of the tree are old" - _ven treiven_ (the ends of the tree are old)
- "the trunk of the tree is small" - _manevtrei_ (the small start of the tree)

ajlor = hello? (first word?)
