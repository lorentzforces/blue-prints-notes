### Working theory

Each room has a pair of artwork produced for it. These pieces will depict items whose words differ by one letter. That letter _seems_ to be the letter which should go in the grid at the location of the room when the pictures are observed in it.

For example: when creating this document, I was in the Study at [4, 8], and the pictures therein were a CROWN and a CROW. Therefore "N" has been filled in at that location in the above message solution.

The solutions may be slightly obtuse for the sake of making a convenient pair of words. For example: a rowboat and a crow were "crow" and "row" resulting in "C".

Not all rooms have a pair of art pieces in them. This is more common for certain kinds of room (hallway, standard room, bedroom), but this is a general trend and not a fast rule.

### Notes in the study

"Face & Ace" - corresponds to [3, 1] with "F"
