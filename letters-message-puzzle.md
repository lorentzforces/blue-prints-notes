### Working theory

Each room has a pair of artwork produced for it. These pieces will depict items whose words differ by one letter. That letter _seems_ to be the letter which should go in the grid at the location of the room when the pictures are observed in it.

For example: when creating this document, I was in the Study at [4, 8], and the pictures therein were a CROWN and a CROW. Therefore "N" has been filled in at that location in the above message solution.

Not all rooms have a pair of art pieces in them. Which rooms have them is currently not tracked, but it may be simply only "blue" rooms.

### Notes in the study

"Face & Ace" - corresponds to [3, 1] with "F"

"Unused Pairings"

Glove | Love (G?)
Sting | Sing (T?)
Crowd | Crow (D?)
Grown | Gown (R?)
Snack | Sack (N?)
