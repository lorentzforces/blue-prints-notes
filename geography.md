Order of bodies in the "Spiral of Stars" (counter-clockwise, starting at bottom and going inward):
- Fennmora

~The Crown of the Blueprints is labeled as "The former Ruby Crown of Orinda Aries, recently set with freshly cut sapphires," which may imply that the realm color for Orinda Aries was _also_ red?~ This is incorrect, the color of Orinda Aries was black.
