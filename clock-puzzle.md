# Clock Puzzle

1. 5:00
2. 5:08
3. 5:57
  - Set this clock to a time containing all different numbers (NOT, so has at least one repeated digit)
4. 6:00
  - This clock's neighbors should both be set to a time containing a 7
5. 7:00
  - This clock should not be set "on the hour" (NOT, so should be set on the hour)
6. 8:00
7. 8:05
  - This clock should be set to a time that contains the same three numbers of another clock here but in reverse order.
8. 9:00

Each of these clocks should be set to a different time.

Five of these clocks should be set to a time ending "on the hour."

None of these clocks should be set to times that contain the number 1, 2, 3, or 4

> _This means that our only permitted digits are 0, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9_

The clocks are positioned so that their times will go up in ascending order.
